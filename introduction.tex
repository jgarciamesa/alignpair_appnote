\section{Introduction}

% sequence alignment is important and heavily used
Sequence alignment is a fundamental task in bioinformatics and a cornerstone
step in comparative and functional genomic studies
\parencite{sequence_alignment_rosenberg_2009}.
% often seen as an ad hoc problem
Modern sequence analysis began with the heuristic homology algorithms of
Needleman and Wunsch in 1970 \parencite{identification_smith_1981} and has
progressed to arrive at current aligners.
However, the alignment of molecular sequences is, in practice, often seen as a
tool and the alignment inference as an ad hoc problem
\parencite{morrison_MSA_2018}.

% despite available aligners, there is room for improvement
% summarize sentence into ~ "alignment is performed in the amino acid space"
A common strategy is to perform alignment inference in the amino acid space
\parencite{bininda2005transalign,abascal2010translatorx}.
While this approach is an improvement over DNA models, it discards information,
underperforms compared to alignment at the codon level, and fails in the
presence of artifacts.
% to correct this common practice is to discard lots of data
Given that errors and artifacts are common in molecular data, this requires
costly curation practices that discard large amounts of information.
% errors in genomic data that lead to erroneous downstream analyses
When uncorrected, errors in genomic datasets can lead to erroneous results in
functional and comparative genomic studies \parencite{estimates_schneider_2009}.

% to address this, we present COATi
Here we present COATi, short for COdon-Aware Alignment Transducer, a statistical
pairwise aligner that incorporates codon substitution models and is
robust to artifacts present in genomic data.
