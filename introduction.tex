\section{Introduction}

% sequence alignment is important and heavily used
Sequence alignment is a cornerstone step in bioinformatics
\parencite{sequence_alignment_rosenberg_2009}.
% errors in genomic data that lead to erroneous downstream analyses
Uncorrected errors in sequence alignment can lead to erroneous results in
functional and comparative genomic studies \parencite{estimates_schneider_2009}.
% to correct this common practice is to discard lots of data
Given that errors and artifacts are common in molecular data, this requires
costly curation practices that discard large amounts of information.
% despite available aligners, there is room for improvement
% summarize sentence into ~ "alignment is performed in the amino acid space"
In addition, a common strategy is to perform alignment inference in the amino
acid space \parencite{bininda2005transalign,abascal2010translatorx}.
While this approach is an improvement over DNA models, it discards information,
underperforms compared to alignment at the codon level, and fails in the
presence of artifacts such as frameshifts and early stop codons.
Although some aligners incorporate codon substitution models, they do not
support frameshifts or lack as statistical model.

% to address this, we present COATi
To address this problem, we present COATi, short for COdon-Aware Alignment
Transducer, a statistical pairwise aligner that incorporates codon substitution
models and is robust to artifacts present in genomic data.
